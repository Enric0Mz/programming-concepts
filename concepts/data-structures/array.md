# Overview

Arrays are one of the most widely used data structures in programming and play a crucial role in building efficient algorithms. They consist of a contiguous space in memory where items of the same type (depending on the programming language) are stored.

## Talking about basic operations complexity

- Access by Index: You can access any position in the array in O(1) time, as long as you know the item’s position.
- Insert or Remove: Depending on memory availability, you may need to move the array to another memory space to create room for inserting or removing items. That’s why these operations are O(n) (in the worst case).

## Example

[0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1]
