# Overview

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

Mathematically speaking, this complexity is harder to understand (unless you are a mathematician), so I will focus on providing clear examples. Essentially, O(N log N) refers to algorithms that involve iterating over an array recursively, often multiple times, which results in this complexity.

# Examples

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

A classic example of O(N log N) complexity is sorting algorithms (excluding bubble sort). Any divide-and-conquer algorithm, such as Merge Sort or Quick Sort, typically falls into this category. These algorithms repeatedly divide the input into smaller parts (log N steps) and process each element (N operations), leading to a total complexity of O(N log N).
