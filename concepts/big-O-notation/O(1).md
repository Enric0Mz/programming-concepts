# Overview

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

O(1) means that a piece of code always has constant time complexity. No matter how much the size of the input scales, the time required to complete the operation remains the same.

## Memory Complexity (Spatial)

O(1) refers to always using a constant amount of memory, regardless of how the input size scales. The same amount of storage is required, no matter the growth of the data.

# Examples

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

Given an array, if we need to find the first element, the time complexity remains constant. Whether the array has 10 or 100,000 elements, retrieving the first element always takes the same amount of time—O(1).

## Memory Complexity (Spatial)

Using the same example, if we need to store the first element of a given array, the required memory remains the same, regardless of the array’s size. Whether storing 10 or 100,000 elements, the memory needed to store a single element remains constant—O(1).
