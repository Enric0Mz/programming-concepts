# Big O notation

This document explains what Big-O notation isâ€”a method for measuring temporal and spatial complexity in computing. It also evaluates the scalability potential of a given piece of code. It is important to note that Big-O does not necessarily measure performance, as performance analysis requires a more in-depth evaluation.
