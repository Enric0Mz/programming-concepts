# Overview

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

When designing algorithms, we often encounter nested loops (a loop inside another loop). This is the most common scenario where O(n^2) complexity appears.

# Examples

## Time Complexity (Temporal)

A classic example is when you need to multiply each number in a given array by every other number in the same array. If you use nested loops, the algorithm will have O(n^2) time complexity because, for each element, you iterate over all elements again.
