## Two Pointers

The two pointers algorithm's objective is to manipulate two pointers (or more commonly, indices) to perform operations on a data structure, with arrays being the most common.

It is suitable for various types of operations, such as reversing arrays and strings, assisting in binary searches, and also when working with another algorithm pattern called the sliding window.

The main strategies are:

Converging Pointers: One pointer starts at the beginning (index 0) and another at the end (index len(array) - 1), moving towards each other. This is common for finding palindromes or reversing arrays.

Same Direction Pointers: Two pointers move in the same direction, but one is paced differently than the other, based on a specific condition. This is very common in sliding window operations.

Fast and Slow: One pointer moves linearly (slow), while the other moves twice, three times, etc., as fast (fast). This is very useful in operations with linked lists, for detecting the middle of the list or identifying cycles.

## Complexidade

Typically, this algorithm will have a time complexity of O(n), as it will traverse the entire array in the worst-case scenario. The space complexity is O(1), as it only allocates the two pointers to perform the logic.
